    // Lets play with this
    // console.log(this);
    // who owns the variable
    // suppose you have a bike/car/cycle
    // you've parked it at ground, who can have a look of it ?
    // you've parked it at your society basement, who can have a look of it ?
    // you've parked it in your room, only you can access it.
    // 1. In Global scope (this => window)
    // 2. Inside a function ?
    // 3. Inside a method(function present in object) ?

    // Summary
    // 1. this(keyword) will always point an object
    // 2. It points to the owner object,either a global or custom object you created
    // 3. It can point to different owner objects through different method that we are
    // going to learn(call, apply, bind)
